# EventProcessor Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The EventProcessor has been refactored to provide a more generic and simplified interface that can accept any type of event data as memory buffers, rather than being tied to the specific `NetworkEvent` structure.

## Key Changes

### 1. Header File Changes (`include/ebpf_gpu_processor.hpp`)

**Removed:**
- `NetworkEvent` struct definition (moved to test utilities)
- `PerformanceStats` struct and related methods
- `process_events_async()` method
- `process_buffer()` method (functionality merged into `process_events`)
- `get_performance_stats()` and `reset_performance_stats()` methods

**Added:**
- Simplified `process_event()` method for single event processing
- Simplified `process_events()` method for multiple events (zero-copy)

**New Interface:**
```cpp
// Single event processing
ProcessingResult process_event(void* event_data, size_t event_size);

// Multiple events processing (zero-copy)
ProcessingResult process_events(void* events_buffer, size_t buffer_size, size_t event_count);
```

### 2. Implementation Changes (`src/ebpf_gpu_processor.cpp`)

**Removed:**
- All performance tracking code and timing measurements
- `NetworkEvent`-specific processing methods
- Complex method overloads for different event types

**Simplified:**
- Direct memory buffer processing without type assumptions
- Streamlined kernel execution without performance overhead
- Single implementation path for all event types

### 3. Test Updates

**Updated Files:**
- `tests/test_utils.hpp` - Added `NetworkEvent` definition for testing
- `tests/test_basic.cpp` - Updated to use new interface
- `tests/test_performance.cpp` - Updated benchmarks for new interface
- `tests/example_usage.cpp` - New example demonstrating usage

**Key Test Changes:**
- All tests now use `process_events(void*, size_t, size_t)` method
- Added single event processing tests
- Removed performance stats validation
- NetworkEvent is now only used in test code

## Benefits of the New Interface

### 1. **Generic Event Support**
- No longer tied to `NetworkEvent` structure
- Can process any event type (network, security, system, etc.)
- Event structure definition is now application-specific

### 2. **Simplified API**
- Only two main processing methods: `process_event` and `process_events`
- Cleaner, more intuitive interface
- Reduced complexity and maintenance overhead

### 3. **Zero-Copy Processing**
- Direct buffer processing without intermediate copies
- Better performance for large event batches
- Memory-efficient operation

### 4. **Better Separation of Concerns**
- EventProcessor focuses solely on GPU kernel execution
- Event type definitions moved to application layer
- Performance monitoring can be implemented at application level if needed

## Migration Guide

### Before (Old Interface):
```cpp
std::vector<NetworkEvent> events;
// ... populate events ...
processor.process_events(events);

// Performance monitoring
auto stats = processor.get_performance_stats();
```

### After (New Interface):
```cpp
std::vector<NetworkEvent> events; // or any event type
// ... populate events ...
size_t buffer_size = events.size() * sizeof(NetworkEvent);
processor.process_events(events.data(), buffer_size, events.size());

// Performance monitoring (if needed) should be implemented at application level
```

## Example Usage

See `tests/example_usage.cpp` for comprehensive examples of:
- Processing network events
- Single event processing
- Custom event type processing
- Generic buffer handling

## Backward Compatibility

This is a breaking change that requires updates to existing code:
- Replace `process_events(vector<NetworkEvent>&)` with `process_events(void*, size_t, size_t)`
- Remove any performance stats related code
- Move `NetworkEvent` definitions to application code
- Update kernel function signatures if needed

## Files Modified

1. `include/ebpf_gpu_processor.hpp` - Interface simplification
2. `src/ebpf_gpu_processor.cpp` - Implementation updates
3. `tests/test_utils.hpp` - Added NetworkEvent for testing
4. `tests/test_basic.cpp` - Updated to new interface
5. `tests/test_performance.cpp` - Updated benchmarks
6. `tests/example_usage.cpp` - New usage examples

The refactoring maintains all core functionality while providing a more flexible and maintainable interface for GPU-accelerated event processing.
